# SoS
Short for Sohom's opinionated Stack.
A collection of helm-charts, docker-compose files and other biolerplate things that I need on a daily basis. Everything is designed to work together and deploy easily.

## What is this ?

I work a LOT of different things and each time I end up creating a bunch of `throw-away` code / config because I _think_ that I will only do it once.

Overtime, I have been doing to _once_ for more than once. Its painful right now.
SO ... this is a collection of these things for anyone to use and benefit from.


But honestly this is an insurnace poliocy for my future self

## How to use ?

1. Clone Repo
2. Go to any directory.
   1. If there is a README.md in that, read it. It will most likely have instructions to do things. Read it.
   2. There might be a makefile. Read that too.
3. Run things based on your tooling of choice
